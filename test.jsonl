One of the most old water regu lating structure in the world is   \nGrand Anicut dam on river Kaveri (1st-2nd Century C E) [1] . Indian agriculture began by 9000 BCE as a result of  early cultivation of plants, and \ndomestication of crops and animals.

Indian products soon reac hed the world via existing trading \nnetworks and foreign crops were introduced to India . Plants and animals—considered \nessential to their survival by the Indians—came to be worshiped and venerated.

Much of the growth in the fisheries \nsector is coming chiefly from the inland fisheries,  which is also beset with some \nformidable problems, including the environmental de gradation of inland waters and \nthe paucity of fish seed. Indeed, at present, hard ly 40 per cent of the country’s fresh \nwater resources are being used for fisheries. The o utput of the inland fisheries sector \ncould, therefore, be stepped up by two-and-half tim es just by utilizing all the available \nwater bodies. Similarly, most of the fisheries pote ntial of deep sea waters is going \nabegging for want of suitable fishing vessels and c urbs on joint ventures for deep sea \nfishing.

I n 1968, 479 village blocks were functioning in various states and they \ncovered 5 million cows and she-buffaloes  which were  about 6.5% of the total breedable female cattle of the country . On review of the functioning  of key vi llage scheme, it was revealed that it did not produce results according to the \nexpectations. Many dairy plants which were set up during the second and third five-year plan were not able to procure sufficient \nquantity of milk. This led to the development of  yet another programme of the dairy  development project, This ICDPs were to be \nstarted in breeding tracks of indigenous breeds of cattle & buffaloes and in the milk sheds of large dairy projects so that \nestablished dairy plants can procure sufficient quantity of milk for processing.

Quality a big concern : More than 70% of the marketable  surplus goes through an informal  channel where quality is a \nbig concern. Sometimes quality is an issue in the formal channel as well. Quality of milk or value -added products is a \nbarrier to entry to the export market, especially the USA and the EU. 2. Poor governance of cooperatives : Prices  decided by cooperatives are not based on fat measurement, which affects \nFarmer’s profitability. In addition, lower prices declared by cooperatives  results in low prices of milk paid by all the \nplayers in the industry. www.ijcrt.org                                          © 2018 IJCRT | Volume 6, Issue 2 April 2018 | ISSN: 2320 -2882  \nIJCRT18926 19 International Journal of Creative  Research Thoughts (IJCRT) www.ijcrt.org  756 \n \n 3.

Farmers  of that, time starts crop production in the riversides by \nusing natural resources. Indian scriptures Ramayana, Rig-Veda , \nand Mahabharata briefly narrate the organic agricultural inputs \nby the farmers a t that time [2]. In Mahabharata Kamadhenu cow \nwas found which is related to agricultural practices. Ramayana \nexplains the cycle of dead things and foul waste stuff that returns \nto earth in the form of nutrients [3]. The ‘Aryans’ word comes from the root wo rd, ‘Arya’ which  \nmeans to cultivate. The word ‘Veda’ means knowledge and \nAgriculture inspired by Vedic knowledge called Vedic \nAgriculture. Vedic texts describe the principles of organic \nfarming like Krishi Parashar, Brihatsamhita, and Manusmriti etc.", "source": "5-2-25-521.pdf#chunk7"}

The United Nations \nConvention to Combat Desertification (UNCCD) specifically refers to desertification as land \ndegradation in drylands, resulting in reduced biological and economic productivity (UNCCD, \n2022). This degradation, whether driven by climate vari ability or human -induced activities, \ndirectly impacts natural resource productivity and biodiversity (Shao et al., 2016). Globally, approximately 3 billion people are affected by land degradation (van der Wiel et al., \n2017; IPCC, 2019). Various assessments suggest that 20 –40% of the world's land area is \nexperiencing degradation to different degrees, with this degradation directly impacting half of \nthe global population and posing risks to nearly 50% of the world's GDP (UNCCD, 2022) . Environmental degradation poses a significant threat to 1.2 billion jobs globally, representing \n40% of the world's workforce, as these jobs rely h eavily on ecosystem services (ILO, 2022). According to the FAO Synthesis Report on the State of the World’s Land and Water Resources \nfor Food and Agriculture (FAO, 2021), South Asia exhibits the highest level of land \ndegradation globally, with 41% of its land  – equivalent to 126 million hectares (Mha)  – strongly \ndegraded due to intense agricultural activity, deforestation, and population pressures  (Figure \n1).", "source": "eco.pdf#chunk32"}

Environmental degradation poses a significant threat to 1.2 billion jobs globally, representing \n40% of the world's workforce, as these jobs rely h eavily on ecosystem services (ILO, 2022). According to the FAO Synthesis Report on the State of the World’s Land and Water Resources \nfor Food and Agriculture (FAO, 2021), South Asia exhibits the highest level of land \ndegradation globally, with 41% of its land  – equivalent to 126 million hectares (Mha)  – strongly \ndegraded due to intense agricultural activity, deforestation, and population pressures  (Figure \n1). Figure 1:  Anthropogenic -induced degradation in different world regions  \nData Source: FAO (2021)  \nSouthern America follows with 16% of its land degraded, amounting to 153 Mha, largely \ndriven by deforestation in the Amazon and cattle ranching. Sub -Saharan Africa has 14% of its \nland affected, with 149 Mha degraded, primarily due to desertification and un sustainable \nfarming. Western and Southeast Asia also experience significant degradation, with 20% and \n24% of their lands affected, respectively, largely due to agricultural expansion and water \nscarcity. Australia and New Zealand face lower degradation  levels at 12%, with 34 Mha \nimpacted. In Western & Central Europe and Eastern Europe & the Russian Federation, \ndegradation rates are lower at 11% and 5%, but these regions still face issues like soil erosion, \nwith 12 Mha and 21 Mha strongly degraded.", "source": "eco.pdf#chunk33"}

Compensatory Afforestation Fund Management and Planning Authority (CAMPA):  \nEstablished under the Compensatory Afforestation Act (2016),  CAMPA manages funds \ngenerated from compensatory afforestation, and afforestation projects undertaken to \ncompensate for forest land diverted for non -forest purposes. These funds are crucial for \nrestoring ecosystems and enhancing forest cover. Green Credit Rules (2023):  Introduced as part of the broader green growth strategy, these \nrules provide financial incentives for entities involved in biodiversity conservation, tree \nplantation, and ecosystem restoration projects. The aim is to create a voluntary market for green \ncredits, where industries can offset their environmental impacts.

India’s participation in international conventions like the Convention on \nBiological Diversity (CBD)  and the Bonn Challenge  further solidifies its policy commitments. Governance involves both the central and state governments, with oversight by bodies like the \nNational Biodiversity Authority  and State Biodiversity Boards . India also integrates \nbiodiversity and ecosystem services in its National Action Plan for Conservation of  Migratory \nSpecies  and Green India Mission . The statutory frameworks of developed countries often differ \nfrom India's in their scope, comprehensiveness, and implementation mechanisms. For instance, \nthe US has the Endangered Species Act , which provide s detailed procedures for the \nconservation of threatened and endangered species, along with stringent penalties for non -\ncompliance. Similarly, the EU's Biodiversity Strategy 2030  includes ambitious targets for \nrestoring ecosystems and addressing biodiversity loss across member states, while Australia’s \nEnvironment Protection and Biodiversity Conservation (EPBC) Act  establishes a robust \nframework for environmental protection, including specific guidelines for managing impacts \non biodiversity. Biodiversity and Land Restoration in India  \nPage 31 of 46 Developed countries have typically benefitted from longer -standing legal and institutional \nframeworks that enable more comprehensive policy integration across various sectors, \nincluding agriculture, forestry, and urban planning. This has resulted in more c ohesive and \neffective conservation strategies, such as the EU's Natura 2000  network , which facilitates \ncollaboration among member states to achieve biodiversity goals.", "source": "eco.pdf#chunk106"}

While India is making significant strides in biodiversity and land restoration, its efforts are \nrelatively recent and face challenges in comprehensive policy integration and enforcement. In \nthis context, India needs to strengthen its legal frameworks and governance structures to \nenhance the efficiency of its biodiversity conservation and restoration efforts. Analysis of Regulatory Enforcement and Policy Implementation  \nIndia's progress in biodiversity conservation, while commendable, faces significant challenges, \nparticularly in regulatory enforcement, land ownership disputes, and illegal deforestation.

As India continues to integrate its sustainability goals with national \ndevelopment priorities, it stands poised to not only restore its ecosystems but also contribute \nsigni ficantly to international initiatives for environmental sustainability and resilience . India’s efforts at biodiversity conservation and land restoration are globally recognized for \nblending modern policy initiatives with rich traditional knowledge and community -driven \napproaches. Comprehensive legal frameworks like the Biological Diversity Act and Forest \nRights Act safeguard ecosystems and support local communities. Initiatives such as the Green \nIndia Mission and the Compensatory Afforestation Fund aim to restore millions of hectar es of \ndegraded land, while program mes like Joint Forest Manage ment (JFM) empower communities \nin forest conservation. The MGNREGA further integrates ecological restoration with rural \nemployment, linking social and ecological goals. Significant progress has been made, with approximately 18.94 million hectares afforested \nbetween 2011 –12 and 2021 –22, and 9.8 million hectares restored under the Bonn Challenge \nBiodiversity and Land Restoration in India  \nPage 42 of 46 since 2011.", "source": "eco.pdf#chunk146"}

In 1970 India was a milk deficient country with a mere \nproduction of 20 million tonnes has now develope d as the \nworld’s largest milk producers with more than 160 million \ntonnes which accounts for 18.5 % of the global milk \nproduction. Milk production was enhanced extensively from \n137.7 million tonnes in 2013 -2014 to 164 million tonnes in \n2016 -2017. During 2 011 – 2014, the annual growth rate of \nmilk production was 4%,  which was improved to 6% during \n2014 -2017 whereas the improvement of global milk \nproduction was only 2% during the same period. Further, it \nwas estimated that India's milk production would outpe rform \nthe global milk production at 4.2% compounded annual \ngrowth rate producing around 185 million tonnes annually \nand is expected to surpass European Union and emerge as the \nlargest producer by 2020  (The Economic Times, 2017) . India, Inspite of its massive production milk and its \nproducts, the consumption of milk is increasing at a very fast \npace. This massive consumption o f milk is due to the increase \nin the purchasing power of people, growing urbanisation, \nchanging food practice, lifestyles, and demographic growth.

Milk consumption in India is substantial due to its largest \nvegetarian population in the world whose only source of an \nanimal -based protein and essential nutrient is milk.

The majority of small and medium dairy farmers had medium\nentrepreneurial behavior. The majority of large dairy farmers had high entrepreneurial\nbehavior; this was due to resource richness and high risk taking ability of large farmers.
